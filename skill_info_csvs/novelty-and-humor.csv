At any time, after invoking WHO DID IT, say ADD ABC where ABC is the name you wish to add to your list of names. Alexa will confirm the name has been added and listen for the next ADD command. Continue to say the word ADD followed by a name until you have completed your list. When the list is complete say ""Alexa Who did it?"" to hear a name from the list. Once the name is spoken, Alexa will listen for 6 seconds to hear a reaction. If you say ""No"" or ""I don't think so"" or ""No way"" Alexa will choose another name from the list. This can continue until the list of names is exhausted. This is helpful if you want Alexa to say a specific person's name. If you say ""Yes' or ""I thought so"" Alexa will confirm the name and stop listening. You can add more names at any time, up to 20 in total.   You can also delete names from the list by saying DELETE ABC where ABC is the name to be removed. To hear a complete list of names at any time say READ NAMES. After each command Alexa continues to listen until you say Good bye or there is a time out (6 seconds). Help is also available at any time by saying HELP. An ideal situation for using ""Who Did It?"" Is when something happens and no child will own up to it. Children enjoy hearing their name or the name of their brother or sister."

If, however, you ask a question in the form ""Is it really true that...?"", the skill will respond saying it is false. Other natural phrasings can work, but the presence of the word ""really"" will always be what makes the answer no instead of yes. For your friends (or your children) who don't know the trick, this will seem like independent confirmation of your opinion."

Let’s face it, getting a child to do their chores can be … well … a chore.  If you’ve made the (some might say) questionable decision to go from the biologically understandable world of raising a single child to the borderline insane universe of raising children, you’ll no doubt know that these little bundles are acutely aware of the equitable distribution of household tasks.  As a caring parent carefully in tune with the feelings of each child you’ve undoubtedly established your own internal mechanism for ensuring nobody lifts more than their fair share of fingers - but the odds are stacked against you.  Kids of today are raised in a world where search engines and voice assistants prove parents wrong a couple dozen times a day - so them being the critical thinkers you’ve raised them to be - why on earth would they believe YOU when you tell them it’s their turn to take out the trash.  The flip side of a tech savvy youth is that they inevitably believe just about anything it tells them - so while you and your tyke might “verbally spar” for hours over who swept the kitchen last time - they’re all too prepared and willing to dutifully adhere to the commands of the disembodied voice echoing from the corner of the living room. Now, if you’ve made the grave mistake of raising your lot to be openly defiant of technology telling them what to do in some sort of misguided attempt to prepare them for the inevitable robot revolution, well then that is your poor decision making catching up with you and you’re going to have to resort to being a competent and respected parent."

They are always saying ""noooo"" and it sounds like they're saying meow so I ask them why they are saying meow.   Note: Some reviews mention difficulty in launching the skill.

When launching the skill try and say ""Alexa, who said meow"" relatively slowly for the best results. This skill is also intended to be a good example of a conversational Alexa skill.  This skill now fully supports the Echo Show and Spot devices with a display. You can ask who said meow by saying ""Alexa who said meow?"" The skill will then guide you through the possible interactions.  You can forget who said meow by responding ""no"" when asked if anyone said meow.
