Santa's Workshop,https://www.amazon.com/TreesWithLeaves-LLC-Santas-Workshop/dp/B082VX1VXT,"Just before the holidays, a frozen container, recently recovered from an iceberg floating in the North Sea, arrived at our offices.  Upon examination of the mysterious container and its contents, we believe we have come into possession of audio recordings from an expedition that successfully made contact with Santa’s famous North Pole workshop. Yes that’s right.  This isn’t just some pretend fantastical audio tour!  These are actual recordings of elves from the North Pole, assembling toys and flying reindeer.  In addition, our researchers also believe there is a moment captured when you can actually hear Santa Claus himself - but only if you listen carefully. If you enable our skill you will be able to listen to the following areas… -Train Depot- Loud whistles in the distance, locomotives blasting in and out of the icy mist. Everywhere, elves creatures, scrambling, unloading barrels of nails, wood, and paint.   Where is it all going? -Toy Hall- A thunderous hallway filled with tiny creatures whirling about assembling toys. Who are they? Rivers of trinkets, ornaments, nicknacks, games, dolls, cutting edge electronics fly into a great hall where miles and miles of brightly colored wapping paper spin together into presents, all flying to and fro.  Whats that in the distance?  A giant sleigh! -The Naughty or Nice Department- Tiny creatures all around, hundreds of them writing names down on an enormous list.  Nice … Nice … Nice … Naughty … Nice … Nice … Naughty … Nice … Who’s naughty and who’s nice? BONUS ACCESS We at Trees With Leaves (developers of fine applications and other useful things) are proud to bring you these recordings in the form of Santa’s Workshop, and would love it if you might consider purchasing some of our bonus access.  This purchase will help us restore some of the more damaged recordings and help us with our ongoing research.  -Woodworking Shop- Tapping, chattering little creatures everywhere … All tapping, sawing, and painting. So many toys! … Trains, cars, dolls, animals. A giant clock ticking and tocking on the wall. -Reindeer Flight Testing- Outside in the reindeer paddock we hear the sounds of reindeer taking flight, practicing for the big day.   Overhead, Dasher and Prancer are racing around in circles. INSTRUCTIONS Fist say … “Alexa, open Santa’s Workshop.” ... after prompt, say … 1 “Visit” or “listen.”  Alexa will take you through the entire collection. Or visit individual locations, for example … Fist say … “Alexa, open Santa’s Workshop.” ... after prompt say … 1. “Visit the Train Depot.” or 2. “Visit the Toy Hall.” or with bonus access 2. “Visit the Toy Hall.” HELP Fist say … “Alexa, open Santa’s Workshop.” ... after prompt say … 1. “Help.” 2. “Send info card.” Feedback and contact We love feedback, please leave a review or contact us at … contact@treeswithleaves.com Privacy Policy https://treeswithleaves.com/swprivacypolicy Terms of Use https://treeswithleaves.com/swtermsofuse"
