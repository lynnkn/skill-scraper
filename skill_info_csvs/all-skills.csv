Whose Turn,https://www.amazon.com/Streets-Ahead-Whose-Turn/dp/B075Q5T3BD/ref=sr_1_137?dchild=1&qid=1624660579&s=alexa-skills&sr=1-137,"If you’re tired of hearing the cries of “it’s not my turn” every time you ask your kid to do something, it might just be time to forfeit this most basic of parental duties to your infallible voice assistant. Let’s face it, getting a child to do their chores can be … well … a chore.  If you’ve made the (some might say) questionable decision to go from the biologically understandable world of raising a single child to the borderline insane universe of raising children, you’ll no doubt know that these little bundles are acutely aware of the equitable distribution of household tasks.  As a caring parent carefully in tune with the feelings of each child you’ve undoubtedly established your own internal mechanism for ensuring nobody lifts more than their fair share of fingers - but the odds are stacked against you.  Kids of today are raised in a world where search engines and voice assistants prove parents wrong a couple dozen times a day - so them being the critical thinkers you’ve raised them to be - why on earth would they believe YOU when you tell them it’s their turn to take out the trash.  The flip side of a tech savvy youth is that they inevitably believe just about anything it tells them - so while you and your tyke might “verbally spar” for hours over who swept the kitchen last time - they’re all too prepared and willing to dutifully adhere to the commands of the disembodied voice echoing from the corner of the living room. Now, if you’ve made the grave mistake of raising your lot to be openly defiant of technology telling them what to do in some sort of misguided attempt to prepare them for the inevitable robot revolution, well then that is your poor decision making catching up with you and you’re going to have to resort to being a competent and respected parent."

You can also ask Alexa to repeat only the question, or just the options. - HELP, to get a reminder on how the game is played, as well as the commands available. ⭐NOTE TO PARENTS/CARERS⭐ Kids Cartoon Quiz was built specifically for children and as such, the content is adapted to a younger audience.

There are doubts amongst students and parents on whether they should do the studies as per the NCERT books or as per other books available in the market. This article will address these questions and help the students and parents to clear their concerns.  National Council of Educational Research and Training is an independent organization of the Government of India set up in India with the sole objective to design and implement a common education system in the entire country. Currently, the role of NCERT is to develop study material for students from class 1 to class 12 which includes the development of NCERT Textbooks, learning material for students, teaching material and reference material for teachers, audio and visual education content, organize various national level examinations and much other useful education material for school level students. NCERT books have been designed in an easy to read and understand format. The teachers in the schools should make the students read and understand the chapters in the schools class room itself. The teachers should make the students understand all the concepts which are given in each chapter. The concentration should be more on making the students understand the topics and concepts more rather than solving the questions which are given at the end of each chapter. The whole purpose of teaching should be to make the student understand the concept and the preparation of the student should be such that if any question comes in the exams from part of the chapter, the student should be able to answer the question from his understanding and not from what he has mugged up. The students should start from plain reading of the chapters followed by a discussion on the topics with the teacher and other students and making sure their understanding is correct followed by solving the questions which are given at the end of the NCERT chapters. The skill presents audio in the Hindi and English Languages."

They virtually get together for challenges - even if they don’t live in the same neighbourhood, have to stay at home because of Corona or are in times of virtual learning. If no one else is there for a voice battle, children can of course also solve quiz questions on their own. LEVOOBA Kids is meant for personal use and will enhance the learning situation of all students while they are at home. NOTE: Multiplayer mode only works after registration on the LEVOOBA website and a successful Account Linking with LEVOOBA Kids. You can do both with your Alexa app. Singleplayer mode does work without any registration or Account Linking. FULL PARENTAL CONTROL Only parents are allowed to set up the LEVOOBA Kids account. They link the account by using the Alexa app. Kids can also play LEVOOBA Kids without accountlinking - the singleplayer mode is always open. SCREEN-FREE DIGITAL LEARNING No reading or writing is necessary – so perfect already for pre-schoolers and first graders. And: LEVOOBA Kids is absolutely screen-free! Kids will learn just by voice-battles. DIVERSE QUESTION TYPES Unlike other voice quizzes LEVOOBA Kids offers multiple options for natural language answers. Instead of only saying answer ""a"", ""b"" or ""c"" kids can give their result after calculating or the letters when spelling straight away. Even whole words and sequences of numbers are possible. LEARN FROM MISTAKES If students give the wrong answer, they get the chance to learn from that. LEVOOBA Kids will explain the correct answer - which helps keeping it in mind. NOTIFICATIONS When a kids challenges another, the preferred opponent will automatically receive a notification. So you’ll always know when someone is challenging you. (Attention: Notifications only work if turned on in the Alexa app. Parents have to guide kids through the process of accepting a challenge.) PHYSICAL ACTIVITY During breaks and waiting periods LEVOOBA Kids encourages physical activity, because physical and mental fitness are tightly linked together. While performing funny activities, the brain turns on its rest mode and will be double the fit for the next voice battle afterwards. TEACHER-FRIENDLY Educators can register their classes for LEVOOBA Kids. They select fitting topics either from our database or they supply their own material. They follow up on the kids' results and learning progress at home, so they can circle it back to their own teaching. LEVOOBA Kids is not designed for classroom usage. It improves digital learning opportunities at home for all students. FEEDBACK What do you think about LEVOOBA Kids? Let us know! You can also contact us with your questions and feedback. If you like playing LEVOOBA Kids, feel free to provide feedback by writing a review or rate the Skill in the Skill store."

This means that even if your child isn't in kindergarten yet, but can count to 25 and has succesfully completed the Next Number skill by Brainpsray, they may be able to solve the ""81 addition facts"" 1st graders aim to achieve. Bigger Number First teaches applies a somewhat new spin to the widespread strategy of adding the biggest (or larger) number first when adding two numbers.  Students using this MathHack are instructed to make a fist with one hand say the larger number, then begin counting up from their using their other hand to add the smaller number. The system, using the Brainspray's Alexa lesson, has taken a child just shy of four years old from being able to add two digits to being able to accurately complete all 81 math facts  within three weeks of starting the program.  Your child may take less time or more time, but they will have a tool that goes beyond rote memorization in their box of solutions needed to master some basic math skills way above schedule. Toddlers and preschoolers can do amazing things with numbers and letters, given the right incentives.  Now you can measure their progress two numbers at a time, while helping them master adding and comparing numbers.  If your toddler or preschooler can count to 25 and add one digit, this lesson is for you."

He composed many sublime poems through a lifetime of traveling the globe and sharing his enlightened message of Ek Onkar, Oneness. The Mool Mantar is said to be the first composition uttered by Guru Nanak Dev Ji upon enlightenment at the age of about 30. The word """"Mool"""" means main or root and """"Mantar"""" means chant or verse. Together the words """"Mool Mantar"""" mean the """"Main chant"""" or """"root verse"""" The Mool Mantar is regarded by many as the thesis of his work. Often described as just a summary of the Divine, the Mool Mantar is actually considered to define and carry a deep implication for human existence. Each of the 9 words (Gems) encompass a truly global concept of habits, traits and mindset we should aim to achieve. By explaining the theories and suggesting practical ways to integrate each of the concepts into your daily life, Nanak Time intends to get you started on this journey of discovery and self-reflection. You can pause and play by saying ""Alexa, pause"" and ""Alexa, resume."" Just say ""Alexa, stop"" when you're done for the day.

This is where they will find Ballicopter, the little red helicopter, flying high through the skies, on his way to visit one of his friends. What will happen and how his adventure will develop, will be decided by the children! They are encouraged to use simple words to select twists in the story, developing voice control interaction with Alexa in a safe environment.  This game was created by experienced audio game developers and is particularly rich in audio. It uses a well-known voice for narration, includes two original songs that your children may want to move, sing, or dance along with, and offers great sound effects that will capture their imagination. Young children who are blind or visually impaired will also be able to enjoy and engage with this story, building self-confidence in the use of voice control technology.  “Every day is a Ballyland day, and a Ballyland day is a happy day!” The game helps to develop: • Simple voice commands to use smart speaker technology with voice control • Language skills • Choice Making skills • Concept of Cause & Effect • Concept of sequencing • Concepts such as nice/bad, slow/fast, grumpy/happy  • Singing and moving along to songs • Recognizing musical instruments and styles"

Upon examination of the mysterious container and its contents, we believe we have come into possession of audio recordings from an expedition that successfully made contact with Santa’s famous North Pole workshop. Yes that’s right.  This isn’t just some pretend fantastical audio tour!  These are actual recordings of elves from the North Pole, assembling toys and flying reindeer.  In addition, our researchers also believe there is a moment captured when you can actually hear Santa Claus himself - but only if you listen carefully. If you enable our skill you will be able to listen to the following areas… -Train Depot- Loud whistles in the distance, locomotives blasting in and out of the icy mist. Everywhere, elves creatures, scrambling, unloading barrels of nails, wood, and paint.   Where is it all going? -Toy Hall- A thunderous hallway filled with tiny creatures whirling about assembling toys. Who are they? Rivers of trinkets, ornaments, nicknacks, games, dolls, cutting edge electronics fly into a great hall where miles and miles of brightly colored wapping paper spin together into presents, all flying to and fro.  Whats that in the distance?  A giant sleigh! -The Naughty or Nice Department- Tiny creatures all around, hundreds of them writing names down on an enormous list.  Nice … Nice … Nice … Naughty … Nice … Nice … Naughty … Nice … Who’s naughty and who’s nice? BONUS ACCESS We at Trees With Leaves (developers of fine applications and other useful things) are proud to bring you these recordings in the form of Santa’s Workshop, and would love it if you might consider purchasing some of our bonus access.  This purchase will help us restore some of the more damaged recordings and help us with our ongoing research.  -Woodworking Shop- Tapping, chattering little creatures everywhere … All tapping, sawing, and painting. So many toys! … Trains, cars, dolls, animals. A giant clock ticking and tocking on the wall. -Reindeer Flight Testing- Outside in the reindeer paddock we hear the sounds of reindeer taking flight, practicing for the big day.   Overhead, Dasher and Prancer are racing around in circles. INSTRUCTIONS Fist say … “Alexa, open Santa’s Workshop.” ... after prompt, say … 1 “Visit” or “listen.”  Alexa will take you through the entire collection. Or visit individual locations, for example … Fist say … “Alexa, open Santa’s Workshop.” ... after prompt say … 1. “Visit the Train Depot.” or 2. “Visit the Toy Hall.” or with bonus access 2. “Visit the Toy Hall.” HELP Fist say … “Alexa, open Santa’s Workshop.” ... after prompt say … 1. “Help.” 2. “Send info card.” Feedback and contact We love feedback, please leave a review or contact us at … contact@treeswithleaves.com Privacy Policy https://treeswithleaves.com/swprivacypolicy Terms of Use https://treeswithleaves.com/swtermsofuse"

Then they can probably start reading some three letter CVC (consonant vowel consonant)  words some ""Letter Monsters"" in a matter of weeks with a little bit of practice.   This skill is designed give parents another way to help very young learners gain fluency in reading words that have just three letters.  There are many reasons this early skill is important to developing reading.    There are about 200 CVC words you will want you early reader to know.  They probably recognize some you didn't even know they were familiar with.  Practicing is key and this skill is one of many tools you can use to keep the process of practicing rewarding and fun. Toddler's and preschoolers that know their phonics can read simple three letter words without knowing how to tell the difference between a vowel and a consonant.   But there are many good reasons but perhaps simplest is that virtually every word used in English has a vowel in it.   You may want to try to the Long Vowel Monster and Short Vowel Monster Alexa skills if your child hasn't had much exposure to the concept of vowels and consonants. As your young learner progresses in reading their ability to quickly decipher, or ""sound out"" more difficult words will improve how fast they can read and how accurately they can read.  This impacts reading comprehension and as a result the ability of your child to teach themselves as they get a little older.   Before most little children can read they've heard ""Old McDonald had a farm, 'E', 'I', 'E', 'I', '0', many times.  Simply knowing that E, I and O are vowels can be helpful.  We hope this skill is also a helpful tool for you and your child find another way to make word sandwiches (consonants are the bread and a vowel is the meat) fun."

If you don't have one, you can still play but you need to make sure you have a device with the Alexa app handy as the words will be shown on the app (on the 'Activity' page). <!> ⭐GAMEPLAY⭐ Simple! Alexa will show you a word on the device's screen or on your Alexa App ('Activity' section), and all you have to do is read the word back. Alexa will then tell you whether your answer is correct or not. You can have as many tries as you want to read the word. The most important is for you to try your best and practice! ⭐COMMANDS⭐ During the game, you can ask Alexa to: 1. WAIT, if you need more time to read the word. Alexa will play a hold music lasting 30 seconds. To interact with Alexa during that period, just say Alexa (or any other wake word if you changed your device's settings). 2. SKIP, if you really can't find the word and want to come back to it later. Alexa will ask you to repeat the word three times to memorize it. 3. tell you HOW MANY STARS you have, if you have been reading well and lost count of the number of stars you have collected.

Fortunately, there are many fun ways to get your young learner to voluntarily explore ordinal values while learning other important things about the world they live in.  Learning about the planets is one way to do this. Toddlers and preschoolers can do amazing things with numbers and letters, given the right incentives.  Now you can measure their progress by adding numbers to five one at a a time by voice, while helping them master adding and comparing numbers.  If your toddler or preschooler can count to ten, this skill is for you. Every child is unique, but they all have to learn some of the same things to succeed.  Planet Monster is a skill you can try yourself and, if it's something you think might fit with your child, you can request to personalize in the following ways:  Choose an incentive (prize) for your child         - One jelly bean         - An apple         - Using the iPad         - A lollipop          - Whatever else you want to offer! If you got something useful out the Planet Monster, tell us in the review comments and, if you want, let us know what you would like changed to better fit your child (number of questions, specific questions, prizes, etc.).  We'll try to incorporate the personalization request into the app for free for the community and let you know when it's ready.  It's that easy!  Have fun and keep feeding those monsters planets!  Yum!"

Then they can probably teach long vowels to some ""Letter Monsters"" in a matter of weeks with a little bit of practice.   This skill is designed give parents another way to help very young learners identify long vowels. Toddler's and preschoolers that know their phonics can read simple three letter words without knowing how to tell the difference between a vowel and a consonant.  So why should your child get to know their vowels as soon as posible?  There are many good reasons but perhaps simplest is that virtually every word used in English has a vowel in it.   As your young learner progresses in reading their ability to quickly decipher, or ""sound out"" more difficult words will improve how fast they can read and how accurately they can read.  This impacts reading comprehension and as a result the ability of your child to teach themselves as they get a little older.   Before most little children can read they've heard ""Old McDonald had a farm, 'E', 'I', 'E', 'I', '0', many times.  Simply knowing that E, I and O are vowels can be helpful.  We hope this skill is also a helpful tool for you and your child find another way to make learning vowels fun."

Then they can probably teach short vowels to some ""Letter Monsters"" in a matter of weeks with a little bit of practice.   This skill is designed give parents another way to help very young learners identify long vowels. Toddler's and preschoolers that know their phonics can read simple three letter words without knowing how to tell the difference between a vowel and a consonant.  So why should your child get to know their vowels as soon as possible?  There are many good reasons but perhaps simplest is that virtually every word used in English has a vowel in it.   As your young learner progresses in reading their ability to quickly decipher, or ""sound out"" more difficult words will impact how quickly and accurately they can read.  This impacts reading comprehension and as a result the ability of your child to teach themselves as they get a little older.   Before most young children can read they've heard ""Old McDonald had a farm, 'E', 'I', 'E', 'I', '0', many times.  Simply knowing that E, I and O are vowels can be helpful.  We hope this skill is also a helpful tool for you and your child to find another way to make learning short vowels fun."

My goal was to create something that would be really easy to use and avoid excess speaking while doing exactly what it is supposed to do: namely, play sleeping sounds for babies, children, or adults!  1) Say next or previous to choose sounds.   - The skill will remember your most recent selection when relaunching. 2) Say turn whisper on or off.  - It will remember your settings whenever you launch so you don't wake your baby up. 3) Say loop on or loop off.  - It will remember your settings and continually loop your current selection. 4) Say play (sound name).  - Jump right to the sound you like. And that is it! Here are the sounds: - Rain - Ambiance - Drone - Vacuum - Stream - River - Fan - Hallway Fan - Thunder I'll keep adding new and different sounds over time so keep your eyes out for those!

The skill is designed to help elementary English learner students and their families acquire the specific vocabulary and language skills that support STEM learning and success.  STEM Familia contains 18 sequential 12-minute lessons. Each lesson targets a single word. To facilitate a dual-language experience, all directions, commentary, and feedback is delivered by a bilingual narrator via the skill’s embedded audio files. Each instructional activity is delivered first in Spanish and then in English. Questions that call for a Spanish language response trigger general feedback that reinforces users’ effort and offers a statement of the correct response. Users’ English language responses trigger specific feedback, with reinforcement for correct answers or corrective feedback for incorrect answers.  To initiate the skill, users say, “Alexa, Open STEM Familia.” A narrator delivers an introductory message in Spanish welcoming families and providing directions about how to access the three possible paths for engagement.  Path 1-“New word” allows users to access a word lesson.  Path 2- “Review words” allows users to review abbreviated lessons of previously learned words. Path 3-“Repeat word” allows users to repeat a specific word lesson. A follow up prompt asks users to specify which word they would like to repeat.  As users complete word lessons, they advance to the next target word lesson. Word lessons. Game 1/new word: When users initiate a new lesson, they hear skill’s narrator giving instruction on the new word (La nueva palabra es ‘evidencia’/The new word is ‘evidence’). The narrator then poses a question to test users’ knowledge (¿Cual es la nueva palabra?/What is the new word?). Users’ responses trigger general feedback in Spanish (Muy bien! La nueva palabra es ‘evidencia’!) or specific feedback in English (Yes, the new word is ‘evidence’/ Good try! The new word is ‘evidence’.)  Game 2/definition: A similar instructional sequence in used for the target word’s definition. Users are given instruction in the target word’s meaning, asked to generate the target word’s meaning, and then given general or specific feedback based on their response.  Game 3/spelling: Users are given instruction on how to spell the target word, then asked to spell the target word. Generic feedback is provided in Spanish and English.  Game 4/usage: To practice usage, users are asked to complete a sentence using the target word and receive general or specific feedback based on their responses. Game 5/synonyms: Users are taught a common synonym for the target word, tested on their ability to recall the synonym, then provided with generic or specific feedback. Game 6/meaning verification game: Users listen to sentences with the target word and are asked to verify (si/no, yes/no) if the correct word meaning is reflected in the sentence. Game 7/complete sentence usage: Users are asked to repeat full sentences that include the target word.  Modeling vignettes: Following a brief review of the target word’s meaning and spelling, users listen to a 30-second Spanish language audio vignette in which a parent and child model an interaction using the target word.  Users then hear a 30-second English language audio vignette in which the same student and his/her teacher interact using the target word in an academic context.  Conclusion: Users hear a Spanish language parting message encouraging them to use the target word in family conversations."

Introducing “Mountain” by Audiolex LLC. Mountain is one of the most well-known dice games, now transformed for you to enjoy through Alexa.  Mountain is a simple arithmetic game for kids all ages. The mountain game can be played directly against Alexa or Alexa can take on the role of the scorekeeper and overseer. Beyond enjoying our game, parents have the option to gain access to our progress-tracking dashboard.  Through this dashboard, parents can monitor their child’s speech & language development over each successive game in accordance to the ASHA Guidelines*.  *ASHA is the American Speech-Hearing-Language Association. More information can be found at https://www.asha.org/about/    ** Make sure ‘Kid Skill Purchasing’ is enabled in your Alexa App to play the full game **  RULES BELOW  ——————————————————————————————————————————— Age: All-ages  Number of players: 1 - 4 (including Alexa)  Equipment: 2 dice (optional)  The object of the game is to be the first to climb your mountain, in number order, and then descend the other side. Youngest player goes first.  First player rolls the dice and hopes for a 1, which will allow them to reach the first step in their mountain. They must ascend in numerical order, so they cannot cross off the 2 until they have crossed off the 1. If they roll a 1 and a 2, however, they can cross ascend both steps in one turn. The player continues rolling dice until they roll numbers that do not match the next step(s) on their mountain. The turn is then passed to the next player. Play continues until someone has made it all the way up their mountain and down the other side in the correct order. You may choose to roll your own, physical dice or have Alexa roll virtual dice for you. If personal dice are rolled, each player has to announce the numbers they’ve rolled in order to climb the mountain or move onto the next player. If Alexa rolls the virtual dice, she will announce the numbers that have been rolled. However, the player still has to repeat the roll outcome in order to continue playing the game.  Alexa may participate as one of the active players or simply maintain score and order of the game.  ——————————————————————————————————————————————————— Mountain skill is suitable for kids and will require verified parental consent if not granted earlier for another kid skill.

Synopsis: Sam and Te Rerehua, visiting Grandma and Pōua at Te Mata Hāpuku (Birdling’s Flat). While collecting agate and fishing for eels from the beach they look up at the stars and their grandmother tells them stories. One night Grandma notices two Matariki stars are missing from the sky.

The two fair-headed children blend in with the patupaiarehe on the beach and ask what is happening.  The patupaiarehe spend so much time skiting about what they’re going to do with the two stolen stars they don’t notice it’s nearly sunrise. When Te Rerehua tells them the sun is coming up, the patupaiarehe run from the beach, fearing their delicate white skins will burn.Pōua launches the two Matariki stars back up into the sky with his eeling gaff, and the nine stars of Matariki are back together again.

Kiddo ABC - Alphabet and Words Learning Skill,https://www.amazon.com/Kid-do-ABC-Alphabets-Learning-Skill/dp/B07Q7YQNS7/ref=sr_1_2254?dchild=1&qid=1624660811&s=alexa-skills&sr=1-2254,"Kiddo ABC is a fun based alphabet learning and vocabulary building skill for small children. The game teaches the new words to kids in increasing order of complexity i.e. starting with simpler words. Game is adaptive in nature i.e. it remembers the words that kids have already used during the game; using that memory game encourages the kids to learn new words instead of repeating the same old word again and again. Also in learn mode game ensures that kids are taught new words instead of the words that they have already used. Skill will start by using any of the following phrases 'Alexa, start abc' 'Alexa, open abc' 'Alexa, launch abc' Skill will then give option to the user to - Learn All letters by saying 'LEARN' or 'LEARN ALL' - Learn individual letters by saying LEARN followed by any letter, as an example 'LEARN D', 'LEARN T' or 'LEARN A' or any valid combination   - Play with letters and words by saying 'PLAY'.  kids can use these options one after the other, as many times as they want. In LEARN ALL mode Alexa will speak out words for all English alphabets one by one starting from A to Z. When learning specific letter Alexa will speak words for only that Letter. Alexa remembers the words that child has already used in PLAY mode, those words are not repeated in the learn mode again, hence allowing for more learning & vocabulary building for kids.  In Play mode, Alexa will ask word for English alphabets, by prompting 'A For'. Kids are supposed to respond with any of the common English words starting with letter A. If word is found to be incorrect, skill will prompt user for one more try. Also if child repeats the same word more than twice that may not be allowed. If word is found to be correct. Skill will continue and ask for next letter i.e. 'B For' and likewise the game will continue and will end with letter 'Z' once the kid has responded correctly with words for all English alphabets.  Alexa will help on its own in case kid gives incorrect responses twice for the same letter. Also kids can take help any moment by saying 'HELP' to Alexa, then Alexa will help back by speaking words for that letter. Once kid has completed all letters, Alexa will revise all letters where either there were mistakes or where help was given. In Play mode, game has a PAUSE feature, so at any letter kids can simply say 'PAUSE', the game will record the letter where child was and next time if the game is restarted within two hours it will resume from that letter instead of starting from A again.  Likewise in Play mode, if child misses to respond to skill's prompts and game stops. In this case also, game will record the letter where child was and next time if the game is restarted within two hours it will resume from that letter instead of starting from A again.  The word list that skill uses contains only the common words as per primary standard. This list is very rich and is continuously updated. In case more complex words are spoken the skill will recognize them. But when in learn mode the skill will only teach the words from its own list, these words are more suitable for small children. Also game arranges its list in increasing order of complexity, so simpler words are taught first followed by difficult ones. Best of Luck Kid! Good fun and great learning to you!"

If each team member has a button, they can use them to determine who gets to answer the question and avoid cluttering the voice input each round. Remember to wake up the buttons by pressing them once the skill starts. --------------------- The best time to play in is around 7pm US eastern time since players from both the West and East coast of the USA are active. It is not much fun playing by yourself, so tell your friends about this to ensure there are more players and points up for grabs. Playing on your lonesome will only get you one point per successful round. Your seven day total score is what determines your standing on the global leaderboard. So you don't need to win every round to be on top. Just play consistently well to stay on top. The maths questions are moderate difficulty (e.g 4 x 22 or 144 / 2 ) so best suited for children between 7 to 13 years. Younger kids can join in by practising with a calculator. If you have multiple devices around the house connected to the same Amazon account then the highest score will be taken for each round, so playing as a team can be beneficial.

As the mass that was held by them disperses, what remains is a small ball of mass. It is of the size of a city, but is extremely dense. In fact, neutron stars are one of the most dense objects. The gravitational pressure makes protons and electrons to become neutrons and make up for most of its density. A star rotates about its axis. When it goes supernova, it does lose a lot of its mass. However, in order to maintain angular momentum, it has to spin faster now [1]. Much faster. And when it does, it emits a blast of radiation along its magnetic field lines.

Times Tables Streak,https://www.amazon.com/Andrej-Grobler-Times-Tables-Streak/dp/B07GWLK3NZ/ref=sr_1_2832?dchild=1&qid=1624660873&s=alexa-skills&sr=1-2832,"How many multiplication and division questions can you get right in a row? 10, 20, 100? Try to beat your personal best across multiple sessions with this engaging skill. You can choose between three activities: reciting, test and streak challenge.  Reciting is a way to quickly memorize an individual times table by listening and chanting along with Alexa who recites the multiples, for example, ""4, 8, 12, 16"", etc. Then, when you're feeling confident to take a test, Alexa will give you a series of random questions for a given times table and check your responses, for example, ""what is 6 times 4?"", ""16 divided by 4?"", etc. During the test, Alexa notes the incorrect answers and repeats those questions, until you get all correct. Kind of like flash cards, just spoken.  In this skill, times tables can go up to 16 by 16 which is the top, ""hard"" level. You begin at the ""easy"" level with tables of up to 8 by 8, while the middle level is called ""moderate"" with tables of up to 12 by 12. You can change the difficulty level at any time by saying, for example, ""set level to moderate"". If you're feeling pretty confident at a certain level, you can try the streak challenge. Unlike with a normal test, in a streak, Alexa asks questions across all times tables of your current level. The streak breaks with the first incorrect answer. Each correct answer brings points based on the difficulty of the question and as you progress Alexa keeps a total score. Alexa also tracks your personal best across multiple sessions and will congratulate you every time you beat it. If you need to leave in a hurry, just say ""pause"" and your streak will automatically resume next time you open the skill. Questions in tests and streaks also include real-life problems, such as: ""Grandma is baking scones for the family of 5. How many does she need to bake if they all eat 4 scones each?"" Most questions come with hints which are offered automatically if you wait for too long with an answer, or you can just say ""help"". For example, on a question ""what is 9 times 6"" the hint would be: ""if you know what 10 times 6 is, just subtract 6 from that"". All tests and streaks include division questions, which come up randomly in about a third of all questions."

Do you want to improve your spelling, but don't like those boring and badly working spelling skills? Then Clever Count is the right skill for you! Clever Count is not only the perfect skill for children, but also for adults who enjoy giving their brain a small exercise session.  Clever Count has been developed to train the brain in translating simple to complex words into characters and help to improve our spelling.  Alexa will tell you a word and you will have to count the number of letters it has. It contains around 9000 different words and allows you to vary between three difficulty levels, easy, medium and hard. There are some special features included into this brain trainer, such as occasionally asking you to count the number of vowels in a word when you are playing on difficulty level hard.  To start training, you will need to enable access to Kid Skills in your Alexa app, as this game is for both children and adults. After that, just say ""Alexa, start clever count."" to start a new training session. Alexa will then set the difficulty level according to your preferences and start asking you for the number of letters in different words, and all you have to do is respond with a number. It is as simple as that! If you are done training, just simply say ""stop"" and Alexa will not only tell you the number of words, of which you counted the number of letters correctly in this practise session, but also the total number across all sessions.  This is all you need to know to start training your brain. Go ahead and try it out! A few helpful features you should know about: If you need help at any point, just say ""help"" and Alexa will explain to you the game mechanics. If you didn't properly understand the word Alexa said, just ask her to repeat it.  If you feel like changing the difficulty level, feel free to tell Alexa to change it for you. If you want to delete your statistics and want a fresh start, just say ""delete my profile"" and Alexa will obey your command.  Be sure to rate Clever Count and tell us if you enjoyed it!"

A gentle alternative to time outs, Cool Down begins with a bit of encouragement and provides one to five minutes of audio to breathe deep, relax your brain, and calm down before going to back to work or play. Parents can use Cool Down to help members of their family to re-center instead of argue. Teachers can use Cool Down to separate students who need to spend a moment peacefully sitting in one spot before returning to classroom activities. Adults can use Cool Down for a few minutes of meditation or deep breathing before or after stressful situations.  Audio selections include ambient sounds like birds or water and calming classical tunes. Attributions:  https://freesound.org/people/tim.kahn/sounds/197714/ https://freesound.org/people/3bagbrew/sounds/95753/ A few things to get the most out of your Cool Down experience:  Remember to be consistent. Cool Down is not a punishment, but can be an alternative to traditional time outs.  Show affection to your child (and yourself!) both before and after Cool Down launches.  Provide a spot to sit and reflect during the Cool Down process. Children often just need a moment to process their strong emotions. Remember to breathe!

Next ball is bowled only when the kid prompts the present score. If he prompts the wrong score, a wicket is taken. Each kid is given two wickets per innings. Hence, the kid with the highest score wins, i.e the one who successfully adds up to the highest total. For example, if kid one sets up a total score of 50 , the second kid needs to successfully add the scores to 51 before the 2 wickets are taken."

The created skill consists of three sections: introduction, the actual game, and the calculation of results. At the beginning, Alexa asks a child for his/her name and then greets a player using the same name to establish a warm and welcoming contact. This feature was achieved by using an Amazon intent of the list of popular GB names. Then, the child listens to the description of the skill.  For example, Alexa: ""Welcome to Mr. Tongue Twister. What is your name?"" Child: ""Hi! I’m John!"" Alexa: """"Hi John. Repeat each tongue twister after me. Remember that I can slow down and repeat each phrase if you ask me. Are you ready to start now?"" Child: ""Yes!"" In the following section, Alexa randomly chooses and reads a tongue twister from the list of kid-friendly tongue twisters. A child can ask Alexa to repeat the phrase slower using a variety of words or phrases such as ""slower,"" ""slow down,"" ""repeat,"" ""what,"" etc.  Alexa will kindly pronounce the same tongue twister in a slower pace to make sure the player understood every word. An important feature of this game is that Alexa will carefully listen to the speaker and let him/her know whether all the words are pronounced correctly. To achieve this, Alexa will repeat exactly what the player said and match it to the built in phrases. The next round of tongue twisters will be pronounced again at a faster pace until the child asks specifically to slow down again. If the tongue twister is pronounced correctly, Alexa will iterate through several possible praising responses to make sure a child knows he/she is doing great. However, if the phrase is mispronounced, Alexa will follow the same structure — repeat what a child said and then say it in the correct way, and move on to a new phrase.  For example, Alexa: ""she sees cheese"" Child: ""she sees cheese"" Alexa: ""She sees cheese is correct! Good job."" Next, ""Penny paid a penny for a pumpkin"" Child: ""Slower"" Alexa: ""P-e-n-n-y p-a-i-d-a-p-e-n-n-y f-o-r-a-p-u-m-p-k-i-n"" Child: ""Penny paid a penny pumpkin"" Alexa: ""Penny paid a penny pumpkin is unfortunately incorrect. The phrase was, ""Penny paid a penny for a pumpkin."" Next ""Upper roller, lower roller""  If a child completes all tongue twisters, Alexa calculates the number of correctly pronounced ones, and asks if he/she wants to continue the game. By saying ""yes"", Alexa starts it again, ""no"" or ""stop"" exit the game.  Mr. Tongue Twister is a great skill for children or ESL learners to sharpen their ear, improve speech defects, and learn how to pronounce phrases at a faster speed. It would be a good exercise to practice both in class or at home."

Eg, Aliens know that “Celsius” is connected to “Temperature” by some relation (unit of measurement), kids have to guess what should “Meter” be related to so aliens can learn a new connection. Periodically, kids also reinforce their knowledge by correcting the sets aliens have made themselves based on previous sets. Second game, Spaceships is about attacking alien ships with equations that equate to a number where the ship is located. Kids start with the “weapon” (aka mathematical operator) of addition and as they play more rounds, they unlock new weapons: subtraction, multiplication and division. Once they have more weapons available, they can decide which one they want to use for each attack. An example of an attack is: if Alexa says there is a spaceship at location 25, it can be destroyed by the kid saying “twenty plus five” (since it equates to the correct location).  And Finally, the third game I-Know-What-I-Know, Aliens try to engage kids in a trivia to test whether they “really” know the answers or if they’re just guessing. Kids get more points answering honestly rather than guessing."

To score a point you would need to answer with “Eighty pineapples,” or ""Eighty four smelly socks."" Alexa is quite generous in her scoring. So if you get the answer right, but say the wrong silly object, she'll probably let you off!  You can ask Alexa to test you on any number, so it's fun for older kids and adults too. Why not try the 256 times table.  Once you have chosen your times table, by saying e.g. ""Test me on seven,"" Alexa will ask you 6 questions. After answering all the questions, she gives you a final score and tells you how long it took you to answer all the questions.  See if you can beat your friends and family by scoring full marks in the fastest time.  But most importantly... have fun!"

The teacher begins by pairing each student up. Each child then turns to their partner, and then the teacher provides each student with a question. Each student then takes a turn answering the question. This method is implemented by providing the students with a random question, a timer so each student knows when their time to talk is done, and also introduces a series of verbal cues that a teacher would introduce to her students prior to use that help to keep children on task. Using the skill is fairly simple. To start the skill, say something to the effect of ""Alexa, ask Classchat to give us a question"", and Alexa will begin by saying, ""Okay everyone, 1, 2, 3, knee to knee!"" This is one of the aforementioned verbal cues, and is the ""turn"" part of ""turn and talk"". At this point, each child would be asked to face their partner. Alexa will then ask a random question from the question database provided. After Alexa asks the question, an internal timer will begin, and this is where a teacher would direct her students to begin to answer the question to one another. The default time is set to 3 minutes, and Alexa will announce when time is halfway finished so the other partner can begin to speak. Once time is up, Alexa will say ""3, 2, 1, talking is done!"", which is another verbal cue meant to return the attention to the teacher. It will then ask the kids to give a ""thumbs up"" if they demonstrated a key communication skill, such as making good eye contact. You can ask Alexa to provide a question that is more focused on a specific topic by saying something like ""ask Classchat to give us a question about respect"". The different topics you can currently choose from are: reading, our strengths, each other, respect, and school. You can also adjust the time allotted for the question by saying something like ""ask Classchat for question for 2 minutes"". A number of different phrasings have been included in the intent schema in order to provide for many different teaching scenarios."

Miss Arcade,https://www.amazon.com/Sara-Carol-Chen-Simon-Guo/dp/B078W3FKR9/ref=sr_1_3341?dchild=1&qid=1624660929&s=alexa-skills&sr=1-3341,"Ever wonder how to get your child to finish his or her homework on time and learn time management, instead of wasting time on watching Youtube or playing games? Meet Miss Arcade, your child’s best friend that will teach them about self discipline and motivate them to do assigned tasks. Miss Arcade is an Alexa skill that targets children in elementary school (ages 6 - 10) with the goal of improving habits and introducing them to money management by earning stars and spending them on prizes. Both parents and their children interact with the skill. Our skill is based on an engaging task system that rewards good habits and promotes self-discipline. It is like an arcade game, but for completing real tasks and earning real-life rewards. Parents are able to set a number of tasks for their children, and specify how many “stars” they will receive on completion. Stars can be redeemed for prizes (like candy or TV time), which the parent also specifies with the Miss Arcade skill. When the child is done, they can report to their parent and the adult can mark the task as completed. Cheating will not be possible, as parents can check which tasks were completed recently and have the ability to reverse it. Both child and parent can ask Miss Arcade what the current star count is and what tasks there are left. This way, tasks can be self driven and done throughout the day, while homework can be done without a parent pestering the kid! By using this skill, children are able to learn more about time management and the rewards of completing work in a timely manner. Additionally, they'll have to save their stars for more valuable prize, introducing financial skills.  Unlike other Alexa skills or mobile apps, Miss Arcade is made specifically for kids and provides the type of fun experience that will help kids continue to engage with Alexa and establish strong foundations for time-management skills.  Process:  - Add prizes (movies, video game time, etc.) to Miss Arcade (parents) and describe how many stars it will take to redeem. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to add reward. Quantities are not stored for prizes, though they can be removed at any time.  - Add tasks (homework, housework) to Miss Arcade (parents) and describe what the task is and how many stars the child will earn after completing it. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to add task. Tasks can be duplicated and removed.  - List tasks and rewards in Miss Arcade (child) and choose one task to work on. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to list tasks. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to list prizes. - The child completes the task and gets stars for rewards.  Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade that homework is now finished. - The child can redeem prizes with his or her stars. Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade to redeem prize. The parents will give the reward to the child. Other features: - Check how many stars the child has. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade how many stars I have. - Remove task in the task list. Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade to cancel homework. - Remove prize in the task list. Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade to remove prize. - Check what the child has finished in the last 24 hours. Ex. Alexa, ask  Miss Arcade what has been done today.  - Uncomplete any task (parents) in case the child lied. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to mark homework uncomplete. Coming features: - Deadlines for tasks and give bonus stars if finished in time. - Streaks for finishing multiple tasks in a row or meet a certain expectation. - Weekly reports on the child’s progress."

This version is completely redone from the ground up, attempting to enhance but maintain the spirit of the original game in a voice-only experience. This game skill simulates owning a lemonade stand. Alexa states the weather forecast for the (simulated) day and then the player buys cups of lemonade to sell, buys signs for advertising, and sets a price for a cup of lemonade. The skill provides clear instructions what's expected of the player. The game goes on forever. You will earn ""experience badges"" as you accumulate playing time and earn money selling lemonade. This is a great game for children, parents to play with their children or educators in a classroom. The game focuses on the following player skills: careful listening, math, money, business, understanding odds and chance statements, and managing expectations. At any time you can ask ""what's the weather"" or say ""tell me the weather"" to have Alexa repeat the weather forecast. You can find out how much money you've earned by asking ""how much do I have"" or ""how much money do I have"". To have the simulated game day number repeated, you can ask ""what day is it"" or ""what's the day"". To see what badges you've earned, say ""Alexa, badges"". You can ask for contextual help by saying “Alexa, help”, immediately go to the next simulated day by saying “Alexa, next day”, or stop the game by saying “Alexa, stop” or ""Alexa, cancel"" to end your game. Your current scores and badges are saved unless you reset your game or disable the skill. You will start with five dollars. If you go under two dollars, you will automatically be bumped back up to five. If you want to reset your game to the beginning (without disabling the skill and enabling it again), you can say ""Alexa, clean slate"" and then repeat the magic words Alexa tells you to say. Tip: When you say a price for a cup of lemonade, include the words ""dollars"" and ""cents"" where appropriate. Good examples are, ""a dollar"", ""a dollar twenty-five"", ""two dollars and twenty-five cents"", ""seventy-five cents"". Want to suggest features or report issues with Lemonade Stand?

Information Mode The child can ask for information about a specific state, such as Virginia by saying, “Alexa, ask State Explorer to tell me about Virginia.” Or they can ask to hear about a random state by saying, “Alexa, ask State Explorer to tell me about a state.”  Alexa will answer with the state’s capital, nickname, motto, bird, and flower. Challenge Mode To take either the State Capital or State Nickname Challenge, the child must first register their first name as a player. So, Bob would say, “Alexa, register Bob.”  Alexa will use the name they give to track the points they earn during their challenges.  A great feature is that State Explorer can keep track of multiple children as long as they use different names. Once registered they can take a challenge by saying, “Alexa ask State Explorer to challenge me on either State Capitals or State Nicknames.”  Alexa will then ask for their Player Name and the Difficulty Level for the questions.  There are 5 multiple choice questions for each round.  The Number of Possible Answers Given and the Points for a Correct Answer each depend on the Difficulty Level.  This explains how that works: Easy – 2 possible answers will be provided, and the correct answer is worth 1 point, Medium – 3 possible answers will be provided and the correct one is worth 3 points, Hard – 4 possible answers and each one correct is worth 5 points. Because Alexa will save the scores from their challenges, the child can find out his or her point totals by saying, “Alexa, tell me my scores,” and giving their Player Name when Alexa asks.  Since State Explorer allows multiple players, kids can compare their scores as they increase their knowledge of the states. State Explorer is a fun way for children to learn some basic information about the states that will help them in school and probably even stump their parents!"

This skill has been created specifically to help children develop their table skills, but it can be used by people of all ages including mum and dad. Times Tables Guru helps you steadily build your Times Tables Skills. Learn the Tables just by saying the Table you want to learn such as “Ten Times Table”. Then once you think you know a Table try answering Alexa’s Table Questions in order, just as you learnt them and then try the same table in random order. If you are new to tables you may like to attempt them in the following order: 1 times table, 10 times table, 2 times table, 5 times table, 11 times table, 4 times table, 3 times table, 6 times table, 9 times table, 8 times table, 7 times table and finally the 12 times table. But that is up to you and you can learn them in any order you wish. If you want Alexa to track your progress then use one of the 4 available nicknames; mum and dad can track their progress too! You can check on your progress at any time by asking Alexa to tell you your progress for the different skills such as:  learn, in order, random, or count up or down. Once you feel you have mastered all the tables you can ask Alexa to ask you questions on 2 tables, 3 tables or 5 tables at once. Once you feel really confident you can take the Mega Test which will ask you all 144 questions across all 12 tables. Getting that right can give you the feeling that you may well be on the way to becoming a Times Tables guru.  Once you approach Guru standard maintain your Table knowledge by using the “Challenge” mode which will test you with 60 questions on 5 random tables. You can also try out the “Count up” or “Count down” options where you just count up or down in steps of 1 to 12 as selected by you. Times Table Guru is there to help you and as such it is forgiving, you can skip some answers if you are not sure and Alexa will say what the answer was, then at the end Alexa will allow you to try the questions you skipped and if you get them right Alexa will count that as a Table completed correctly (as long as you didn’t get any wrong!). If you are not sure what was asked, just say “repeat” and Alexa will repeat the question without penalty. Even Alexa isn’t quite perfect and she occasionally confuses 90 with nineteen and 80 with eighteen. And it can be frustrating if you are doing the mega test or a multi-table test and Alexa confuses those terms and decides you were wrong when you weren’t! So, in Times Tables Guru, Alexa has been programmed to avoid such confusion for some critical numbers which reduces the likelihood of frustration.  To learn the two times table say ""two times table"". Alexa will then teach you the 2 times table.  To answer the 12 questions on the two times table sequentially say  “in order two"". Alexa will then start at 2 x 1 = ? and ask you the 12 questions on the 2 times table or any other you have selected.  To answer the 12 questions on the five times table in a random order  say ""random five"". Alexa will ask you twelve 5 times tables questions in a random order. At the end Alexa will tell you how many you got right and the correct answers to any you got wrong. If all answers are correct and you are using a nickname, Alexa will record your result.  To count up in fives up to 5 times 12 say “count five”. Alexa will give you a start number, 5 in this case, and you will count up in 5s starting with that number: 5, 10, 15, 20 etc. Alexa will confirm you are correct each time.  To count down in fives starting at 5 times 12 say “count down five”. As before Alexa provides the start number, which is the first number you say. For more instructions just say ""help"" when using the skill."

""A is for alligator."" ""Now it is your turn.  Say ""A is for alligator.""   Alexa listens for the response before moving to the next letter.

Your child won't be bored by playing the same game over and over again!  When Alexa reaches Z, she gives the child an option to play again.

So, here is a simple, yet powerful way to achieve it. Now, this trick is being scientifically proven in the most prestigious Institute of Medical Science of India, AIIMS. The research work was carried out for the last 20 years. Before going deep into what Gayatri Mantra means and unravel its magical benefits. It’s important to know the meaning of Mantra first. Mantra is a sacred utterance, a numinous sound, a syllable, word or phonemes, or group of words in Sanskrit believed by practitioners to have psychological and /or spiritual powers. The earliest mantras were composed in Vedic Sanskrit in India, and are at least 3000 years old. Mantras now exist in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. In the Japanese Shingon tradition, the word Shingon means mantra. Similar hymns, antiphons, chants, composition, and concepts are found in Zoroastrianism, Taoism, Christianity and elsewhere. This mantra should be chanted with closed eyes and with full devotion. Usually 12, 24 or 108 times one can chant. The preferred time for chanting is before noon that is in the morning or in Sandhya Kaal (one hour after sunset). AIIMS has recently confirmed it through the research of the brain activation by MRI, that on chanting Gayatri Mantra over a period of time it expands the Prefrontal cortex of the brain. It was conducted on men of 25 -30 years for a period of 9 months and after that, data was studied for 5 years. It was observed that there are remarkable changes in the brain especially in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. The work of this part is to make a plan, solve problems and to be aware. Those who were reciting the mantras were releasing a chemical called GABA, lack of this chemical causes sleep deprivation and depression-like diseases. Usage User: Alexa, open Gayatri mantra Alexa: Starting Gayatri mantra for kids, please say start or begin User: Start Alexa: Plays the Audio You can always play, resume, pause, stop next or previous and move according to the audio streams.

If you do then continue reading. Positive affirmations are phrases/beliefs used to challenge negative or unhelpful thoughts. As children learn behaviours and wire their brain, affirmations are very useful for developing a child's self belief. Every one of us has a strong belief system about the world and ourselves. This was learned from the environment around us. Positive words can help shape this belief system. For example, if your affirmation is ""when I fail, I say I can't do it YET, and try again"", and you fail at something, the affirmation will trigger in your brain and remind you that you can do it, you just need to keep trying. Without this positive affirmation, you might think that if you fail at something then you can never do it and will just give up without trying again.
