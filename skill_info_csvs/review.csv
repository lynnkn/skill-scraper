The teacher begins by pairing each student up. Each child then turns to their partner, and then the teacher provides each student with a question. Each student then takes a turn answering the question. This method is implemented by providing the students with a random question, a timer so each student knows when their time to talk is done, and also introduces a series of verbal cues that a teacher would introduce to her students prior to use that help to keep children on task. Using the skill is fairly simple. To start the skill, say something to the effect of ""Alexa, ask Classchat to give us a question"", and Alexa will begin by saying, ""Okay everyone, 1, 2, 3, knee to knee!"" This is one of the aforementioned verbal cues, and is the ""turn"" part of ""turn and talk"". At this point, each child would be asked to face their partner. Alexa will then ask a random question from the question database provided. After Alexa asks the question, an internal timer will begin, and this is where a teacher would direct her students to begin to answer the question to one another. The default time is set to 3 minutes, and Alexa will announce when time is halfway finished so the other partner can begin to speak. Once time is up, Alexa will say ""3, 2, 1, talking is done!"", which is another verbal cue meant to return the attention to the teacher. It will then ask the kids to give a ""thumbs up"" if they demonstrated a key communication skill, such as making good eye contact. You can ask Alexa to provide a question that is more focused on a specific topic by saying something like ""ask Classchat to give us a question about respect"". The different topics you can currently choose from are: reading, our strengths, each other, respect, and school. You can also adjust the time allotted for the question by saying something like ""ask Classchat for question for 2 minutes"". A number of different phrasings have been included in the intent schema in order to provide for many different teaching scenarios."

Meet Miss Arcade, your child’s best friend that will teach them about self discipline and motivate them to do assigned tasks. Miss Arcade is an Alexa skill that targets children in elementary school (ages 6 - 10) with the goal of improving habits and introducing them to money management by earning stars and spending them on prizes. Both parents and their children interact with the skill. Our skill is based on an engaging task system that rewards good habits and promotes self-discipline. It is like an arcade game, but for completing real tasks and earning real-life rewards. Parents are able to set a number of tasks for their children, and specify how many “stars” they will receive on completion. Stars can be redeemed for prizes (like candy or TV time), which the parent also specifies with the Miss Arcade skill. When the child is done, they can report to their parent and the adult can mark the task as completed. Cheating will not be possible, as parents can check which tasks were completed recently and have the ability to reverse it. Both child and parent can ask Miss Arcade what the current star count is and what tasks there are left. This way, tasks can be self driven and done throughout the day, while homework can be done without a parent pestering the kid! By using this skill, children are able to learn more about time management and the rewards of completing work in a timely manner. Additionally, they'll have to save their stars for more valuable prize, introducing financial skills.  Unlike other Alexa skills or mobile apps, Miss Arcade is made specifically for kids and provides the type of fun experience that will help kids continue to engage with Alexa and establish strong foundations for time-management skills.  Process:  - Add prizes (movies, video game time, etc.) to Miss Arcade (parents) and describe how many stars it will take to redeem. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to add reward. Quantities are not stored for prizes, though they can be removed at any time.  - Add tasks (homework, housework) to Miss Arcade (parents) and describe what the task is and how many stars the child will earn after completing it. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to add task. Tasks can be duplicated and removed.  - List tasks and rewards in Miss Arcade (child) and choose one task to work on. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to list tasks. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to list prizes. - The child completes the task and gets stars for rewards.  Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade that homework is now finished. - The child can redeem prizes with his or her stars. Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade to redeem prize. The parents will give the reward to the child. Other features: - Check how many stars the child has. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade how many stars I have. - Remove task in the task list. Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade to cancel homework. - Remove prize in the task list. Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade to remove prize. - Check what the child has finished in the last 24 hours. Ex. Alexa, ask  Miss Arcade what has been done today.  - Uncomplete any task (parents) in case the child lied. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to mark homework uncomplete. Coming features: - Deadlines for tasks and give bonus stars if finished in time. - Streaks for finishing multiple tasks in a row or meet a certain expectation. - Weekly reports on the child’s progress."

Inspired from the Mool Mantar composed by Guru Nanak Dev Ji, this app explores universal concepts such as Oneness, Truthful Living and living Without Fear and Hate. Specifically created to work around your busy lifestyle, the app allows you to: * Explore the 9 Gems of Mool Mantar by listening to short Audio Lessons and Guided Meditations * Apply the essence of the Gems to your daily life with simple-to-follow guides and hands-on exercises *Journal your thoughts and experiences * Use the reminders to keep you on track to complete your lessons * Enjoy the ripple effect of the simple exercises designed to impact the community around you Guru Nanak Dev Ji was the first of ten Sikh Guru’s and was born in 1469. He composed many sublime poems through a lifetime of traveling the globe and sharing his enlightened message of Ek Onkar, Oneness. The Mool Mantar is said to be the first composition uttered by Guru Nanak Dev Ji upon enlightenment at the age of about 30. The word """"Mool"""" means main or root and """"Mantar"""" means chant or verse. Together the words """"Mool Mantar"""" mean the """"Main chant"""" or """"root verse"""" The Mool Mantar is regarded by many as the thesis of his work. Often described as just a summary of the Divine, the Mool Mantar is actually considered to define and carry a deep implication for human existence. Each of the 9 words (Gems) encompass a truly global concept of habits, traits and mindset we should aim to achieve. By explaining the theories and suggesting practical ways to integrate each of the concepts into your daily life, Nanak Time intends to get you started on this journey of discovery and self-reflection. You can pause and play by saying ""Alexa, pause"" and ""Alexa, resume."" Just say ""Alexa, stop"" when you're done for the day. When listening to podcasts you can say ""Alexa, shuffle"" to shuffle the playing order, or ""Alexa, loop"" to loop the current episode. You can also ask for previous and next episodes by saying ""Alexa, previous"" and ""Alexa, next""."

A gentle alternative to time outs, Cool Down begins with a bit of encouragement and provides one to five minutes of audio to breathe deep, relax your brain, and calm down before going to back to work or play. Parents can use Cool Down to help members of their family to re-center instead of argue. Teachers can use Cool Down to separate students who need to spend a moment peacefully sitting in one spot before returning to classroom activities. Adults can use Cool Down for a few minutes of meditation or deep breathing before or after stressful situations.  Audio selections include ambient sounds like birds or water and calming classical tunes. Attributions:  https://freesound.org/people/tim.kahn/sounds/197714/ https://freesound.org/people/3bagbrew/sounds/95753/ A few things to get the most out of your Cool Down experience:  Remember to be consistent. Cool Down is not a punishment, but can be an alternative to traditional time outs.  Show affection to your child (and yourself!) both before and after Cool Down launches.  Provide a spot to sit and reflect during the Cool Down process. Children often just need a moment to process their strong emotions. Remember to breathe!

Whose Turn,2.9 out of 5,79,https://www.amazon.com/Streets-Ahead-Whose-Turn/dp/B075Q5T3BD/ref=sr_1_137?dchild=1&qid=1624660579&s=alexa-skills&sr=1-137,"If you’re tired of hearing the cries of “it’s not my turn” every time you ask your kid to do something, it might just be time to forfeit this most basic of parental duties to your infallible voice assistant. Let’s face it, getting a child to do their chores can be … well … a chore.  If you’ve made the (some might say) questionable decision to go from the biologically understandable world of raising a single child to the borderline insane universe of raising children, you’ll no doubt know that these little bundles are acutely aware of the equitable distribution of household tasks.  As a caring parent carefully in tune with the feelings of each child you’ve undoubtedly established your own internal mechanism for ensuring nobody lifts more than their fair share of fingers - but the odds are stacked against you.  Kids of today are raised in a world where search engines and voice assistants prove parents wrong a couple dozen times a day - so them being the critical thinkers you’ve raised them to be - why on earth would they believe YOU when you tell them it’s their turn to take out the trash.  The flip side of a tech savvy youth is that they inevitably believe just about anything it tells them - so while you and your tyke might “verbally spar” for hours over who swept the kitchen last time - they’re all too prepared and willing to dutifully adhere to the commands of the disembodied voice echoing from the corner of the living room. Now, if you’ve made the grave mistake of raising your lot to be openly defiant of technology telling them what to do in some sort of misguided attempt to prepare them for the inevitable robot revolution, well then that is your poor decision making catching up with you and you’re going to have to resort to being a competent and respected parent."

Calm Now,4.2 out of 5,58,https://www.amazon.com/For-Jack-Jill-Calm-Now/dp/B07641PP42/ref=sr_1_3636?dchild=1&qid=1624660961&s=alexa-skills&sr=1-3636,"We as humans are delightful creatures until we're not.  Whether its anger or sadness, this Alexa skill, Calm Now, walks through proven calming techniques such as taking deep breaths, counting to 10, and shaking out your legs like you have a whole bunch of fire ants in your pants.  Although originally targeted to kids, we've also found this skill to be helpful for some adults we know (not naming names).   Ideally kids using this skill will learn the techniques so well that eventually they can calm themselves down without the help of Alexa.  Ideally adults using this skill will also find it helpful, while appreciating its playful nature. We value feedback and suggestions which can be sent to lesley@forjackandjill.com.
