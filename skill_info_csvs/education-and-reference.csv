There are doubts amongst students and parents on whether they should do the studies as per the NCERT books or as per other books available in the market. This article will address these questions and help the students and parents to clear their concerns.  National Council of Educational Research and Training is an independent organization of the Government of India set up in India with the sole objective to design and implement a common education system in the entire country. Currently, the role of NCERT is to develop study material for students from class 1 to class 12 which includes the development of NCERT Textbooks, learning material for students, teaching material and reference material for teachers, audio and visual education content, organize various national level examinations and much other useful education material for school level students. NCERT books have been designed in an easy to read and understand format. The teachers in the schools should make the students read and understand the chapters in the schools class room itself. The teachers should make the students understand all the concepts which are given in each chapter. The concentration should be more on making the students understand the topics and concepts more rather than solving the questions which are given at the end of each chapter. The whole purpose of teaching should be to make the student understand the concept and the preparation of the student should be such that if any question comes in the exams from part of the chapter, the student should be able to answer the question from his understanding and not from what he has mugged up. The students should start from plain reading of the chapters followed by a discussion on the topics with the teacher and other students and making sure their understanding is correct followed by solving the questions which are given at the end of the NCERT chapters. The skill presents audio in the Hindi and English Languages."

They virtually get together for challenges - even if they don’t live in the same neighbourhood, have to stay at home because of Corona or are in times of virtual learning. If no one else is there for a voice battle, children can of course also solve quiz questions on their own. LEVOOBA Kids is meant for personal use and will enhance the learning situation of all students while they are at home. NOTE: Multiplayer mode only works after registration on the LEVOOBA website and a successful Account Linking with LEVOOBA Kids. You can do both with your Alexa app. Singleplayer mode does work without any registration or Account Linking. FULL PARENTAL CONTROL Only parents are allowed to set up the LEVOOBA Kids account. They link the account by using the Alexa app. Kids can also play LEVOOBA Kids without accountlinking - the singleplayer mode is always open. SCREEN-FREE DIGITAL LEARNING No reading or writing is necessary – so perfect already for pre-schoolers and first graders. And: LEVOOBA Kids is absolutely screen-free! Kids will learn just by voice-battles. DIVERSE QUESTION TYPES Unlike other voice quizzes LEVOOBA Kids offers multiple options for natural language answers. Instead of only saying answer ""a"", ""b"" or ""c"" kids can give their result after calculating or the letters when spelling straight away. Even whole words and sequences of numbers are possible. LEARN FROM MISTAKES If students give the wrong answer, they get the chance to learn from that. LEVOOBA Kids will explain the correct answer - which helps keeping it in mind. NOTIFICATIONS When a kids challenges another, the preferred opponent will automatically receive a notification. So you’ll always know when someone is challenging you. (Attention: Notifications only work if turned on in the Alexa app. Parents have to guide kids through the process of accepting a challenge.) PHYSICAL ACTIVITY During breaks and waiting periods LEVOOBA Kids encourages physical activity, because physical and mental fitness are tightly linked together. While performing funny activities, the brain turns on its rest mode and will be double the fit for the next voice battle afterwards. TEACHER-FRIENDLY Educators can register their classes for LEVOOBA Kids. They select fitting topics either from our database or they supply their own material. They follow up on the kids' results and learning progress at home, so they can circle it back to their own teaching. LEVOOBA Kids is not designed for classroom usage. It improves digital learning opportunities at home for all students. FEEDBACK What do you think about LEVOOBA Kids? Let us know! You can also contact us with your questions and feedback.

If you do then continue reading. Positive affirmations are phrases/beliefs used to challenge negative or unhelpful thoughts. As children learn behaviours and wire their brain, affirmations are very useful for developing a child's self belief. Every one of us has a strong belief system about the world and ourselves. This was learned from the environment around us. Positive words can help shape this belief system. For example, if your affirmation is ""when I fail, I say I can't do it YET, and try again"", and you fail at something, the affirmation will trigger in your brain and remind you that you can do it, you just need to keep trying. Without this positive affirmation, you might think that if you fail at something then you can never do it and will just give up without trying again. Simply ask Alexa to get todays positive words for your child. To hear the next word say 'next'"

This is a great opportunity for you to reinforce math skills that require practice, help your child reinforce some nearly acquired math skills and assess how close they are to future math concepts.   Most of all, this is a fun and safe environment to introduce your child to the reality that both familiar and new math problems can be solved correctly using different methods.

Inspired from the Mool Mantar composed by Guru Nanak Dev Ji, this app explores universal concepts such as Oneness, Truthful Living and living Without Fear and Hate. Specifically created to work around your busy lifestyle, the app allows you to: * Explore the 9 Gems of Mool Mantar by listening to short Audio Lessons and Guided Meditations * Apply the essence of the Gems to your daily life with simple-to-follow guides and hands-on exercises *Journal your thoughts and experiences * Use the reminders to keep you on track to complete your lessons * Enjoy the ripple effect of the simple exercises designed to impact the community around you Guru Nanak Dev Ji was the first of ten Sikh Guru’s and was born in 1469. He composed many sublime poems through a lifetime of traveling the globe and sharing his enlightened message of Ek Onkar, Oneness. The Mool Mantar is said to be the first composition uttered by Guru Nanak Dev Ji upon enlightenment at the age of about 30. The word """"Mool"""" means main or root and """"Mantar"""" means chant or verse. Together the words """"Mool Mantar"""" mean the """"Main chant"""" or """"root verse"""" The Mool Mantar is regarded by many as the thesis of his work. Often described as just a summary of the Divine, the Mool Mantar is actually considered to define and carry a deep implication for human existence. Each of the 9 words (Gems) encompass a truly global concept of habits, traits and mindset we should aim to achieve. By explaining the theories and suggesting practical ways to integrate each of the concepts into your daily life, Nanak Time intends to get you started on this journey of discovery and self-reflection. You can pause and play by saying ""Alexa, pause"" and ""Alexa, resume."" Just say ""Alexa, stop"" when you're done for the day. When listening to podcasts you can say ""Alexa, shuffle"" to shuffle the playing order, or ""Alexa, loop"" to loop the current episode.

Bigger Number First teaches applies a somewhat new spin to the widespread strategy of adding the biggest (or larger) number first when adding two numbers.  Students using this MathHack are instructed to make a fist with one hand say the larger number, then begin counting up from their using their other hand to add the smaller number. The system, using the Brainspray's Alexa lesson, has taken a child just shy of four years old from being able to add two digits to being able to accurately complete all 81 math facts  within three weeks of starting the program.

For every 10 words read properly, you get a star. The stars you collect give you access to higher levels introducing new words. <!> NOTE: Because this skill is about reading, it is better suited for devices with a screen. If you don't have one, you can still play but you need to make sure you have a device with the Alexa app handy as the words will be shown on the app (on the 'Activity' page). <!> ⭐GAMEPLAY⭐ Simple! Alexa will show you a word on the device's screen or on your Alexa App ('Activity' section), and all you have to do is read the word back. Alexa will then tell you whether your answer is correct or not. You can have as many tries as you want to read the word. The most important is for you to try your best and practice! ⭐COMMANDS⭐ During the game, you can ask Alexa to: 1. WAIT, if you need more time to read the word. Alexa will play a hold music lasting 30 seconds. To interact with Alexa during that period, just say Alexa (or any other wake word if you changed your device's settings). 2. SKIP, if you really can't find the word and want to come back to it later. Alexa will ask you to repeat the word three times to memorize it. 3. tell you HOW MANY STARS you have, if you have been reading well and lost count of the number of stars you have collected. If you or you little one enjoy this game, please show your support by rating this skill and leaving a review. The objective is to make this game interesting enough for kids to be willing to practice reading all those words regularly, so if you have any suggestion to improve the game, or encounter any issue or bug while playing, please get in touch by emailing me at translationfd@gmail.com.

Then they can probably start reading some three letter CVC (consonant vowel consonant)  words some ""Letter Monsters"" in a matter of weeks with a little bit of practice.   This skill is designed give parents another way to help very young learners gain fluency in reading words that have just three letters.  There are many reasons this early skill is important to developing reading.    There are about 200 CVC words you will want you early reader to know.  They probably recognize some you didn't even know they were familiar with.  Practicing is key and this skill is one of many tools you can use to keep the process of practicing rewarding and fun. Toddler's and preschoolers that know their phonics can read simple three letter words without knowing how to tell the difference between a vowel and a consonant.   But there are many good reasons but perhaps simplest is that virtually every word used in English has a vowel in it.   You may want to try to the Long Vowel Monster and Short Vowel Monster Alexa skills if your child hasn't had much exposure to the concept of vowels and consonants. As your young learner progresses in reading their ability to quickly decipher, or ""sound out"" more difficult words will improve how fast they can read and how accurately they can read.  This impacts reading comprehension and as a result the ability of your child to teach themselves as they get a little older.   Before most little children can read they've heard ""Old McDonald had a farm, 'E', 'I', 'E', 'I', '0', many times.  Simply knowing that E, I and O are vowels can be helpful.  We hope this skill is also a helpful tool for you and your child find another way to make word sandwiches (consonants are the bread and a vowel is the meat) fun."

Then they can probably teach short vowels to some ""Letter Monsters"" in a matter of weeks with a little bit of practice.   This skill is designed give parents another way to help very young learners identify long vowels. Toddler's and preschoolers that know their phonics can read simple three letter words without knowing how to tell the difference between a vowel and a consonant.  So why should your child get to know their vowels as soon as possible?  There are many good reasons but perhaps simplest is that virtually every word used in English has a vowel in it.   As your young learner progresses in reading their ability to quickly decipher, or ""sound out"" more difficult words will impact how quickly and accurately they can read.  This impacts reading comprehension and as a result the ability of your child to teach themselves as they get a little older.   Before most young children can read they've heard ""Old McDonald had a farm, 'E', 'I', 'E', 'I', '0', many times.  Simply knowing that E, I and O are vowels can be helpful.  We hope this skill is also a helpful tool for you and your child to find another way to make learning short vowels fun."

Choose an incentive (prize) for your child         - One jelly bean         - An apple         - Using the iPad         - A lollipop          - Whatever else you want to offer! 3.  Name the skill something your child will love         - That's right, this can become your own skill, you can even have your child tell you what the name should be To get started, go through the skill alone to determine if the sample monster is a good fit for your little one's current level and tastes.  This will insure that a)  the early counter is familiar with at least two of the five items in the review and b) that the default incentive in this version (a jelly bean) is something you have and am willing to give the child if they complete the review to your satisfaction.  If it's not, just customize the incentive. If you got something useful out the Number Monster, tell us in the review comments and, if you want, let us know what you would liked changed to better fit your child (number of questions, specific questions, prizes, etc.).

Introducing “Mountain” by Audiolex LLC. Mountain is one of the most well-known dice games, now transformed for you to enjoy through Alexa.  Mountain is a simple arithmetic game for kids all ages. The mountain game can be played directly against Alexa or Alexa can take on the role of the scorekeeper and overseer. Beyond enjoying our game, parents have the option to gain access to our progress-tracking dashboard.  Through this dashboard, parents can monitor their child’s speech & language development over each successive game in accordance to the ASHA Guidelines*.  *ASHA is the American Speech-Hearing-Language Association. More information can be found at https://www.asha.org/about/    ** Make sure ‘Kid Skill Purchasing’ is enabled in your Alexa App to play the full game **  RULES BELOW  ——————————————————————————————————————————— Age: All-ages  Number of players: 1 - 4 (including Alexa)  Equipment: 2 dice (optional)  The object of the game is to be the first to climb your mountain, in number order, and then descend the other side. Youngest player goes first.  First player rolls the dice and hopes for a 1, which will allow them to reach the first step in their mountain. They must ascend in numerical order, so they cannot cross off the 2 until they have crossed off the 1. If they roll a 1 and a 2, however, they can cross ascend both steps in one turn. The player continues rolling dice until they roll numbers that do not match the next step(s) on their mountain. The turn is then passed to the next player. Play continues until someone has made it all the way up their mountain and down the other side in the correct order. You may choose to roll your own, physical dice or have Alexa roll virtual dice for you. If personal dice are rolled, each player has to announce the numbers they’ve rolled in order to climb the mountain or move onto the next player. If Alexa rolls the virtual dice, she will announce the numbers that have been rolled. However, the player still has to repeat the roll outcome in order to continue playing the game.  Alexa may participate as one of the active players or simply maintain score and order of the game.  ——————————————————————————————————————————————————— Mountain skill is suitable for kids and will require verified parental consent if not granted earlier for another kid skill.

Kiddo ABC - Alphabet and Words Learning Skill,https://www.amazon.com/Kid-do-ABC-Alphabets-Learning-Skill/dp/B07Q7YQNS7/ref=sr_1_979?dchild=1&qid=1624647259&rnid=14284832011&s=alexa-skills&sr=1-979,"Kiddo ABC is a fun based alphabet learning and vocabulary building skill for small children. The game teaches the new words to kids in increasing order of complexity i.e. starting with simpler words. Game is adaptive in nature i.e. it remembers the words that kids have already used during the game; using that memory game encourages the kids to learn new words instead of repeating the same old word again and again. Also in learn mode game ensures that kids are taught new words instead of the words that they have already used. Skill will start by using any of the following phrases 'Alexa, start abc' 'Alexa, open abc' 'Alexa, launch abc' Skill will then give option to the user to - Learn All letters by saying 'LEARN' or 'LEARN ALL' - Learn individual letters by saying LEARN followed by any letter, as an example 'LEARN D', 'LEARN T' or 'LEARN A' or any valid combination   - Play with letters and words by saying 'PLAY'.  kids can use these options one after the other, as many times as they want. In LEARN ALL mode Alexa will speak out words for all English alphabets one by one starting from A to Z. When learning specific letter Alexa will speak words for only that Letter. Alexa remembers the words that child has already used in PLAY mode, those words are not repeated in the learn mode again, hence allowing for more learning & vocabulary building for kids.  In Play mode, Alexa will ask word for English alphabets, by prompting 'A For'. Kids are supposed to respond with any of the common English words starting with letter A. If word is found to be incorrect, skill will prompt user for one more try. Also if child repeats the same word more than twice that may not be allowed. If word is found to be correct. Skill will continue and ask for next letter i.e. 'B For' and likewise the game will continue and will end with letter 'Z' once the kid has responded correctly with words for all English alphabets.  Alexa will help on its own in case kid gives incorrect responses twice for the same letter. Also kids can take help any moment by saying 'HELP' to Alexa, then Alexa will help back by speaking words for that letter. Once kid has completed all letters, Alexa will revise all letters where either there were mistakes or where help was given. In Play mode, game has a PAUSE feature, so at any letter kids can simply say 'PAUSE', the game will record the letter where child was and next time if the game is restarted within two hours it will resume from that letter instead of starting from A again.  Likewise in Play mode, if child misses to respond to skill's prompts and game stops. In this case also, game will record the letter where child was and next time if the game is restarted within two hours it will resume from that letter instead of starting from A again.  The word list that skill uses contains only the common words as per primary standard. This list is very rich and is continuously updated. In case more complex words are spoken the skill will recognize them. But when in learn mode the skill will only teach the words from its own list, these words are more suitable for small children. Also game arranges its list in increasing order of complexity, so simpler words are taught first followed by difficult ones. Best of Luck Kid! Good fun and great learning to you!"

As the mass that was held by them disperses, what remains is a small ball of mass. It is of the size of a city, but is extremely dense. In fact, neutron stars are one of the most dense objects. The gravitational pressure makes protons and electrons to become neutrons and make up for most of its density. A star rotates about its axis. When it goes supernova, it does lose a lot of its mass. However, in order to maintain angular momentum, it has to spin faster now [1]. Much faster. And when it does, it emits a blast of radiation along its magnetic field lines.

Try to beat your personal best across multiple sessions with this engaging skill. You can choose between three activities: reciting, test and streak challenge.  Reciting is a way to quickly memorize an individual times table by listening and chanting along with Alexa who recites the multiples, for example, ""4, 8, 12, 16"", etc. Then, when you're feeling confident to take a test, Alexa will give you a series of random questions for a given times table and check your responses, for example, ""what is 6 times 4?"", ""16 divided by 4?"", etc. During the test, Alexa notes the incorrect answers and repeats those questions, until you get all correct. Kind of like flash cards, just spoken.  In this skill, times tables can go up to 16 by 16 which is the top, ""hard"" level. You begin at the ""easy"" level with tables of up to 8 by 8, while the middle level is called ""moderate"" with tables of up to 12 by 12. You can change the difficulty level at any time by saying, for example, ""set level to moderate"". If you're feeling pretty confident at a certain level, you can try the streak challenge. Unlike with a normal test, in a streak, Alexa asks questions across all times tables of your current level. The streak breaks with the first incorrect answer. Each correct answer brings points based on the difficulty of the question and as you progress Alexa keeps a total score. Alexa also tracks your personal best across multiple sessions and will congratulate you every time you beat it. If you need to leave in a hurry, just say ""pause"" and your streak will automatically resume next time you open the skill. Questions in tests and streaks also include real-life problems, such as: ""Grandma is baking scones for the family of 5. How many does she need to bake if they all eat 4 scones each?"" Most questions come with hints which are offered automatically if you wait for too long with an answer, or you can just say ""help"". For example, on a question ""what is 9 times 6"" the hint would be: ""if you know what 10 times 6 is, just subtract 6 from that"". All tests and streaks include division questions, which come up randomly in about a third of all questions."

Do you want to improve your spelling, but don't like those boring and badly working spelling skills? Then Clever Count is the right skill for you! Clever Count is not only the perfect skill for children, but also for adults who enjoy giving their brain a small exercise session.  Clever Count has been developed to train the brain in translating simple to complex words into characters and help to improve our spelling.  Alexa will tell you a word and you will have to count the number of letters it has. It contains around 9000 different words and allows you to vary between three difficulty levels, easy, medium and hard. There are some special features included into this brain trainer, such as occasionally asking you to count the number of vowels in a word when you are playing on difficulty level hard.  To start training, you will need to enable access to Kid Skills in your Alexa app, as this game is for both children and adults. After that, just say ""Alexa, start clever count."" to start a new training session. Alexa will then set the difficulty level according to your preferences and start asking you for the number of letters in different words, and all you have to do is respond with a number. It is as simple as that! If you are done training, just simply say ""stop"" and Alexa will not only tell you the number of words, of which you counted the number of letters correctly in this practise session, but also the total number across all sessions.  This is all you need to know to start training your brain. Go ahead and try it out! A few helpful features you should know about: If you need help at any point, just say ""help"" and Alexa will explain to you the game mechanics. If you didn't properly understand the word Alexa said, just ask her to repeat it.  If you feel like changing the difficulty level, feel free to tell Alexa to change it for you. If you want to delete your statistics and want a fresh start, just say ""delete my profile"" and Alexa will obey your command.  Be sure to rate Clever Count and tell us if you enjoyed it!"

Mr. Tongue Twister,https://www.amazon.com/xLearn-Mr-Tongue-Twister/dp/B078XQC43F/ref=sr_1_1387?dchild=1&qid=1624647311&rnid=14284832011&s=alexa-skills&sr=1-1387,"Mr. Tongue Twister is an educational skill created to help young learners (8-12 year olds) as well as non-native English speakers improve their listening and speaking skills. The created skill consists of three sections: introduction, the actual game, and the calculation of results. At the beginning, Alexa asks a child for his/her name and then greets a player using the same name to establish a warm and welcoming contact. This feature was achieved by using an Amazon intent of the list of popular GB names. Then, the child listens to the description of the skill.  For example, Alexa: ""Welcome to Mr. Tongue Twister. What is your name?"" Child: ""Hi! I’m John!"" Alexa: """"Hi John. Repeat each tongue twister after me. Remember that I can slow down and repeat each phrase if you ask me. Are you ready to start now?"" Child: ""Yes!"" In the following section, Alexa randomly chooses and reads a tongue twister from the list of kid-friendly tongue twisters. A child can ask Alexa to repeat the phrase slower using a variety of words or phrases such as ""slower,"" ""slow down,"" ""repeat,"" ""what,"" etc.  Alexa will kindly pronounce the same tongue twister in a slower pace to make sure the player understood every word. An important feature of this game is that Alexa will carefully listen to the speaker and let him/her know whether all the words are pronounced correctly. To achieve this, Alexa will repeat exactly what the player said and match it to the built in phrases. The next round of tongue twisters will be pronounced again at a faster pace until the child asks specifically to slow down again. If the tongue twister is pronounced correctly, Alexa will iterate through several possible praising responses to make sure a child knows he/she is doing great. However, if the phrase is mispronounced, Alexa will follow the same structure — repeat what a child said and then say it in the correct way, and move on to a new phrase.  For example, Alexa: ""she sees cheese"" Child: ""she sees cheese"" Alexa: ""She sees cheese is correct! Good job."" Next, ""Penny paid a penny for a pumpkin"" Child: ""Slower"" Alexa: ""P-e-n-n-y p-a-i-d-a-p-e-n-n-y f-o-r-a-p-u-m-p-k-i-n"" Child: ""Penny paid a penny pumpkin"" Alexa: ""Penny paid a penny pumpkin is unfortunately incorrect. The phrase was, ""Penny paid a penny for a pumpkin."" Next ""Upper roller, lower roller""  If a child completes all tongue twisters, Alexa calculates the number of correctly pronounced ones, and asks if he/she wants to continue the game. By saying ""yes"", Alexa starts it again, ""no"" or ""stop"" exit the game.  Mr. Tongue Twister is a great skill for children or ESL learners to sharpen their ear, improve speech defects, and learn how to pronounce phrases at a faster speed. It would be a good exercise to practice both in class or at home."

Teaching children about the art of meditation is the ideal age to begin the process of self awareness and has far reaching benefits than when taught in adulthood. 'Awakening soul' sets up the right environment that is required to do meditation by kids. When asked for ‘meditation’, it offers different types of meditation techniques originating from Buddha's way of meditating that are scientifically proven to improve your mood, calm your mind, relax your body, enhance life force and help you develop healthy self esteem. When asked for ‘teachings’, it teaches you excellent values taught by Buddha through the medium of randomly chosen story from plenty of short and crisp stories that help you retain these morals and include in your behavioral conduct. When asked for 'quotes', it also presents the kid with many and many quotations by Buddha that would give you an insight and nurture your emotional well being. It gives them an expansive and relaxed way of thinking which help you bring clarity and to reach your full potential. When asked for ‘Buddha’s life’, Awakening soul also introduces you with the life of Buddha. You can choose to know any of the phases of Buddha's life by asking it about 'Early life', 'Mid life' and 'late life'. The purpose of telling about the life story is to make a better understanding of the transformation Buddha went through his journey of life that ultimately lead him to realization and enlightenment. The kind of questions Buddha is perplexed by in the childhood is a lot relatable to the never ending curiosity the kids have in their childhood phase too which the parents are not able to clarify out in the right way sometimes or it becomes too difficult for a child to comprehend.

The teacher begins by pairing each student up. Each child then turns to their partner, and then the teacher provides each student with a question. Each student then takes a turn answering the question. This method is implemented by providing the students with a random question, a timer so each student knows when their time to talk is done, and also introduces a series of verbal cues that a teacher would introduce to her students prior to use that help to keep children on task. Using the skill is fairly simple. To start the skill, say something to the effect of ""Alexa, ask Classchat to give us a question"", and Alexa will begin by saying, ""Okay everyone, 1, 2, 3, knee to knee!"" This is one of the aforementioned verbal cues, and is the ""turn"" part of ""turn and talk"". At this point, each child would be asked to face their partner. Alexa will then ask a random question from the question database provided. After Alexa asks the question, an internal timer will begin, and this is where a teacher would direct her students to begin to answer the question to one another. The default time is set to 3 minutes, and Alexa will announce when time is halfway finished so the other partner can begin to speak. Once time is up, Alexa will say ""3, 2, 1, talking is done!"", which is another verbal cue meant to return the attention to the teacher. It will then ask the kids to give a ""thumbs up"" if they demonstrated a key communication skill, such as making good eye contact. You can ask Alexa to provide a question that is more focused on a specific topic by saying something like ""ask Classchat to give us a question about respect"". The different topics you can currently choose from are: reading, our strengths, each other, respect, and school. You can also adjust the time allotted for the question by saying something like ""ask Classchat for question for 2 minutes"". A number of different phrasings have been included in the intent schema in order to provide for many different teaching scenarios."

Meet Miss Arcade, your child’s best friend that will teach them about self discipline and motivate them to do assigned tasks. Miss Arcade is an Alexa skill that targets children in elementary school (ages 6 - 10) with the goal of improving habits and introducing them to money management by earning stars and spending them on prizes. Both parents and their children interact with the skill. Our skill is based on an engaging task system that rewards good habits and promotes self-discipline. It is like an arcade game, but for completing real tasks and earning real-life rewards. Parents are able to set a number of tasks for their children, and specify how many “stars” they will receive on completion. Stars can be redeemed for prizes (like candy or TV time), which the parent also specifies with the Miss Arcade skill. When the child is done, they can report to their parent and the adult can mark the task as completed. Cheating will not be possible, as parents can check which tasks were completed recently and have the ability to reverse it. Both child and parent can ask Miss Arcade what the current star count is and what tasks there are left. This way, tasks can be self driven and done throughout the day, while homework can be done without a parent pestering the kid! By using this skill, children are able to learn more about time management and the rewards of completing work in a timely manner. Additionally, they'll have to save their stars for more valuable prize, introducing financial skills.  Unlike other Alexa skills or mobile apps, Miss Arcade is made specifically for kids and provides the type of fun experience that will help kids continue to engage with Alexa and establish strong foundations for time-management skills.  Process:  - Add prizes (movies, video game time, etc.) to Miss Arcade (parents) and describe how many stars it will take to redeem. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to add reward. Quantities are not stored for prizes, though they can be removed at any time.  - Add tasks (homework, housework) to Miss Arcade (parents) and describe what the task is and how many stars the child will earn after completing it. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to add task. Tasks can be duplicated and removed.  - List tasks and rewards in Miss Arcade (child) and choose one task to work on. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to list tasks. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to list prizes. - The child completes the task and gets stars for rewards.  Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade that homework is now finished. - The child can redeem prizes with his or her stars. Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade to redeem prize. The parents will give the reward to the child. Other features: - Check how many stars the child has. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade how many stars I have. - Remove task in the task list. Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade to cancel homework. - Remove prize in the task list. Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade to remove prize. - Check what the child has finished in the last 24 hours. Ex. Alexa, ask  Miss Arcade what has been done today.  - Uncomplete any task (parents) in case the child lied. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to mark homework uncomplete. Coming features: - Deadlines for tasks and give bonus stars if finished in time. - Streaks for finishing multiple tasks in a row or meet a certain expectation. - Weekly reports on the child’s progress."

Information Mode The child can ask for information about a specific state, such as Virginia by saying, “Alexa, ask State Explorer to tell me about Virginia.” Or they can ask to hear about a random state by saying, “Alexa, ask State Explorer to tell me about a state.”  Alexa will answer with the state’s capital, nickname, motto, bird, and flower. Challenge Mode To take either the State Capital or State Nickname Challenge, the child must first register their first name as a player. So, Bob would say, “Alexa, register Bob.”  Alexa will use the name they give to track the points they earn during their challenges.  A great feature is that State Explorer can keep track of multiple children as long as they use different names. Once registered they can take a challenge by saying, “Alexa ask State Explorer to challenge me on either State Capitals or State Nicknames.”  Alexa will then ask for their Player Name and the Difficulty Level for the questions.  There are 5 multiple choice questions for each round.  The Number of Possible Answers Given and the Points for a Correct Answer each depend on the Difficulty Level.  This explains how that works: Easy – 2 possible answers will be provided, and the correct answer is worth 1 point, Medium – 3 possible answers will be provided and the correct one is worth 3 points, Hard – 4 possible answers and each one correct is worth 5 points. Because Alexa will save the scores from their challenges, the child can find out his or her point totals by saying, “Alexa, tell me my scores,” and giving their Player Name when Alexa asks.  Since State Explorer allows multiple players, kids can compare their scores as they increase their knowledge of the states. State Explorer is a fun way for children to learn some basic information about the states that will help them in school and probably even stump their parents!"

This skill has been created specifically to help children develop their table skills, but it can be used by people of all ages including mum and dad. Times Tables Guru helps you steadily build your Times Tables Skills. Learn the Tables just by saying the Table you want to learn such as “Ten Times Table”. Then once you think you know a Table try answering Alexa’s Table Questions in order, just as you learnt them and then try the same table in random order. If you are new to tables you may like to attempt them in the following order: 1 times table, 10 times table, 2 times table, 5 times table, 11 times table, 4 times table, 3 times table, 6 times table, 9 times table, 8 times table, 7 times table and finally the 12 times table. But that is up to you and you can learn them in any order you wish. If you want Alexa to track your progress then use one of the 4 available nicknames; mum and dad can track their progress too! You can check on your progress at any time by asking Alexa to tell you your progress for the different skills such as:  learn, in order, random, or count up or down. Once you feel you have mastered all the tables you can ask Alexa to ask you questions on 2 tables, 3 tables or 5 tables at once. Once you feel really confident you can take the Mega Test which will ask you all 144 questions across all 12 tables. Getting that right can give you the feeling that you may well be on the way to becoming a Times Tables guru.  Once you approach Guru standard maintain your Table knowledge by using the “Challenge” mode which will test you with 60 questions on 5 random tables. You can also try out the “Count up” or “Count down” options where you just count up or down in steps of 1 to 12 as selected by you. Times Table Guru is there to help you and as such it is forgiving, you can skip some answers if you are not sure and Alexa will say what the answer was, then at the end Alexa will allow you to try the questions you skipped and if you get them right Alexa will count that as a Table completed correctly (as long as you didn’t get any wrong!). If you are not sure what was asked, just say “repeat” and Alexa will repeat the question without penalty. Even Alexa isn’t quite perfect and she occasionally confuses 90 with nineteen and 80 with eighteen. And it can be frustrating if you are doing the mega test or a multi-table test and Alexa confuses those terms and decides you were wrong when you weren’t! So, in Times Tables Guru, Alexa has been programmed to avoid such confusion for some critical numbers which reduces the likelihood of frustration.  To learn the two times table say ""two times table"". Alexa will then teach you the 2 times table.  To answer the 12 questions on the two times table sequentially say  “in order two"". Alexa will then start at 2 x 1 = ? and ask you the 12 questions on the 2 times table or any other you have selected.  To answer the 12 questions on the five times table in a random order  say ""random five"". Alexa will ask you twelve 5 times tables questions in a random order. At the end Alexa will tell you how many you got right and the correct answers to any you got wrong. If all answers are correct and you are using a nickname, Alexa will record your result.  To count up in fives up to 5 times 12 say “count five”. Alexa will give you a start number, 5 in this case, and you will count up in 5s starting with that number: 5, 10, 15, 20 etc. Alexa will confirm you are correct each time.  To count down in fives starting at 5 times 12 say “count down five”. As before Alexa provides the start number, which is the first number you say. For more instructions just say ""help"" when using the skill."

Once you set how high you want to be quizzed on, Let's Multiply will ask you if you want the questions to be in order, or random. As you are learning your multiplication table you may want to start in order, then as you get better and need to be challenged, you can try random problems.  You can say ""repeat"" to hear a problem again if you didn't hear it the first time.   You can start over any time by saying ""Start Over"", or just say the new table high value you want to go to, such as ""five times five"".  At any time you can say ""stop"" or ""cancel"" and you will be told the number of correct answers you gave, and the number of incorrect answers you gave, out of the total possible math problems.  So have fun, and learn your multiplication table. Send suggestions, comments, pictures of Alexa teaching you multiplication, etc., to  support@wobblemouth.com.
