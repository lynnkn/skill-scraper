Maths Monsters is great for children to learn the times tables whilst having fun and competing to reach the top of the leaderboard. We have partnered up with select schools to allow them to see the results anonymously which will allow them to help children in the classroom by working on areas of the times table where a bit more practice is required.

The following In-Skill products are available for purchase to extend the game with additional colors: - Color Package 1: violet, orange, white, turquoise - Color Package 2: pink, lime, gold, lavender, coral The game continues to run until it is stopped with the voice command ""Alexa, stop"". Note: ======== Echo Buttons are not supported on FireTV Stick. The colors are chosen directly on the screen with the help of the remote control.

Particular effort has been made to promote key areas of communication development. * Listening - The riddles rhyme so as to be engaging for ears young and old. * Memory - To recall earlier clues and combine with later ones and deduce the animal. * Turn Taking - Alexa models the key process of speaking in turn before giving the player a chance to guess. * Building Vocabulary - Uses a variety of language to deepen the semantic knowledge of words. * Clear Speech - Alexa accepts common mispronunciations of animals (ie 'munti' for 'monkey') and models the correct pronunciation. * Visual Association - On Echo devices with screens, the skill associates the word with engaging pictures. * Positive Reinforcement - Alexa encourages the player positively, there is no score keeping and no penalty for incorrect answers. * Repetition - The format doesn't change, so each of the above is positively reinforced with each new play. If you are enjoying the game, leave us a review! Terms ------- All effort has been made to ensure the animal facts are accurate at the time of writing.

You probably already know how to play this game but if you don't keep on reading... HOW TO PLAY: Enable the skill. Stand at least 6 steps away from your Alexa device. Then shout ""Alexa, open What's the time Mr Wolf."" Mr wolf will then tell you the time, which will be the number of steps you need to come closer.  If he says 3 O'clock. Then you need to take 3 steps closer to your Alexa device.  If you don't have much space then just do small steps when you are given the time. BE WARNED! Mr Wolf is a hungry chap and if you ask him the time enough it will eventually be DINNER TIME!! When it's dinner time you need to turn around and run away to safety. Safety can be your starting point or a base that you decided at the start of the game.   Good luck! ON SCREEN: If you have a device with a screen you will get to see what Mr Wolf looks like. Even when it's dinner time. FEEDBACK: If you loved the game then please do give the skill a 5 star rating and tell all your friends.

For Example: If the opened page is 154, then the last unit is 4 so the score is 4. So the possible scores are 2, 4, 6, 8. 4)2, 4 and 6 score will be added to the batsman score as such and 8 will be counted as 3 runs, it is decided at the beginning of the game when the decide on the number of bats man. 5) Close the book and open it again. 6) Note the score for that again. 7) The innings will go on until 2.0 over’s is complete 8) At the end whoever has the bigger score is the Winner But for the voice cricket we need not have a book or pen ,Just an alexa with voice cricket game enabled skill How to Voice cricket: 1) Just enable skill and launch it 2) Once you have updated your name alexa will bat for 12 balls (2.0 over’s) and will give the target 3) You just have to hit the ball to score the runs ,rest alexa will take car. 4) You can bat for 2.0 over’s(12 balls) and chase the target Alexa will suggest the required runs from balls remaining"

Like cricket, the game is played by 2 kids, with each of them adding runs in their respective innings. A random number between 0-6 is generated indicating the number of runs scored on the particular ball. The kid needs to keep track of the total score by adding the runs scored on each ball.  Next ball is bowled only when the kid prompts the present score. If he prompts the wrong score, a wicket is taken. Each kid is given two wickets per innings. Hence, the kid with the highest score wins, i.e the one who successfully adds up to the highest total. For example, if kid one sets up a total score of 50 , the second kid needs to successfully add the scores to 51 before the 2 wickets are taken."

Each of the games is targeted to teach and practice a different skill in an entertaining way to kids.  First game, Teach-The-Word asks kids to teach new words to the alien visitors using word analogies. They get alien-coins in return for teaching them correct words and reinforcing their knowledge. Eg, Aliens know that “Celsius” is connected to “Temperature” by some relation (unit of measurement), kids have to guess what should “Meter” be related to so aliens can learn a new connection. Periodically, kids also reinforce their knowledge by correcting the sets aliens have made themselves based on previous sets. Second game, Spaceships is about attacking alien ships with equations that equate to a number where the ship is located. Kids start with the “weapon” (aka mathematical operator) of addition and as they play more rounds, they unlock new weapons: subtraction, multiplication and division. Once they have more weapons available, they can decide which one they want to use for each attack. An example of an attack is: if Alexa says there is a spaceship at location 25, it can be destroyed by the kid saying “twenty plus five” (since it equates to the correct location).  And Finally, the third game I-Know-What-I-Know, Aliens try to engage kids in a trivia to test whether they “really” know the answers or if they’re just guessing. Kids get more points answering honestly rather than guessing."

This version is completely redone from the ground up, attempting to enhance but maintain the spirit of the original game in a voice-only experience. This game skill simulates owning a lemonade stand. Alexa states the weather forecast for the (simulated) day and then the player buys cups of lemonade to sell, buys signs for advertising, and sets a price for a cup of lemonade. The skill provides clear instructions what's expected of the player. The game goes on forever. You will earn ""experience badges"" as you accumulate playing time and earn money selling lemonade. This is a great game for children, parents to play with their children or educators in a classroom. The game focuses on the following player skills: careful listening, math, money, business, understanding odds and chance statements, and managing expectations. At any time you can ask ""what's the weather"" or say ""tell me the weather"" to have Alexa repeat the weather forecast. You can find out how much money you've earned by asking ""how much do I have"" or ""how much money do I have"". To have the simulated game day number repeated, you can ask ""what day is it"" or ""what's the day"". To see what badges you've earned, say ""Alexa, badges"". You can ask for contextual help by saying “Alexa, help”, immediately go to the next simulated day by saying “Alexa, next day”, or stop the game by saying “Alexa, stop” or ""Alexa, cancel"" to end your game. Your current scores and badges are saved unless you reset your game or disable the skill. You will start with five dollars. If you go under two dollars, you will automatically be bumped back up to five. If you want to reset your game to the beginning (without disabling the skill and enabling it again), you can say ""Alexa, clean slate"" and then repeat the magic words Alexa tells you to say. Tip: When you say a price for a cup of lemonade, include the words ""dollars"" and ""cents"" where appropriate. Good examples are, ""a dollar"", ""a dollar twenty-five"", ""two dollars and twenty-five cents"", ""seventy-five cents"". Want to suggest features or report issues with Lemonade Stand?
